Heavy rainfall events have significant implications for climate variability and environmental dynamics in Bangladesh. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of rainfall patterns and anomalies over recent years, focusing on their deviation from long-term averages. Using key metrics such as 10-day rainfall (rfh), 1-month and 3-month rolling aggregations (r1h, r3h), and their respective long-term averages (rfh_avg, r1h_avg, r3h_avg), the study quantifies the extent and trends of rainfall anomalies (rfq, r1q, r3q).The analysis reveals notable temporal and seasonal variations in rainfall, with distinct periods of above-average and below-average precipitation. Anomalies in both short-term (10-day) and aggregated (1-month, 3-month) rainfall highlight patterns that may be indicative of changing climatic conditions. The results emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis of rainfall dynamics to better understand their implications for agriculture, water resource management, and regional climate systems.This report underscores the need for integrating historical and current rainfall data to identify emerging trends and develop data-driven strategies for addressing potential challenges associated with extreme rainfall variations in Bangladesh.
